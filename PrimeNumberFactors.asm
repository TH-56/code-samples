MOV 0x10, #8 ; User input here (the number you want to check).
MOV SP, #0x3F ; Places the stack at location 0x40.
SJMP MAIN ; Jumps to the main function.

; ========================================

MAIN: ; The main function:

PUSH 0x10 ; Push the parameter onto the stack.
ACALL SUBR ; Calls the subroutine and pushes the return address onto the stack (LOWB, HIGHB).
POP 0x00 ; Pushes the result of the checker into R0.
MOV A, R0 ; Moves result into the ACC for checking.
JZ PRIMEFACTORS ; Jumps to check the prime factors when the number is not prime.
MOV 0x70, 0x10 ; Put the prime number into the proper memory location for display to user.
JNZ ENDPROG ; Jumps to the end of the program when the number is prime.

; ========================================
